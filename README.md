1. Simulator for a Simplified MIPS Processor

  In this project a simulator has been implemented to show the entire pipeline of the processor. 3 input files (Instructions, registers and the data memory) are given as an input to the system. The systems processes these inputs, executes the necessary operations and writes a step by step output to a file. 


Stay tuned for updates and the addition of new projects.
